# Look into Park's MTBS product
# For MTBS, need to manually input download link, emailed to me
# Possibly don't provide code to download mtbs, bc so many links need to be copy-pasted; just provide merged data
# and add test cases to ensure existing merged data are complete, for the shapefiles with metadata + burn severity mosaics
    # need to manually document # of unique fire ids we would expect per year for all CA wildfires from 1990-2020
# Add logging for any fires missing burn severity mosaics
